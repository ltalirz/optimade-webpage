Designing new materials suitable for specific applications is a long, complex, and costly process.
Researchers think of new ideas based on intuition and experience.
Their synthesis and evaluation require a tremendous amount of trial and error.
In the last few years, there has been a major game change in materials design.
Thanks to the exponential growth of computer power and the development of
robust first-principles electronic structure codes, it has become possible to perform
large sets of calculations automatically.
This is the burgeoning area of high-throughput ab initio computation.
Such calculations have been used to create large databases containing the calculated
properties of existing and hypothetical materials, many of which have appeared online:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://aflowlib.org/">the AFLOW distributed materials property repository</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://aiida.net/">AiiDA</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://molecularspace.org/">the Harvard Clean Energy Project Database</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://materialsproject.org/">the Materials Project</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://nomad-repository.eu/">the NoMaD (Novel Materials Discovery) Repository</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://oqmd.org/">the Open Quantum Materials Database</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://cmr.fysik.dtu.dk/">the Computational Materials Repository</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://suncat.stanford.edu/">the Data Catalyst Genome</a></li>
	<li>â€¦</li>
</ul>

The aim of OPTiMaDe is to work in the direction of making these databases interoperational
by developing a common REST API.
The <a href="https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/OPTiMaDe/blob/develop/optimade.md" target="_blank">latest version</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/OPTiMaDe/blob/develop/AUTHORS" target="_blank">list of contributors</a>)
is now available.
It can also be downloaded from the
<a href="https://github.com/Materials-Consortia" target="_blank">Materials-Consortia GitHub repository</a>.
